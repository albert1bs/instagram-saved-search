# ðŸš€ Render Deployment Guide - Fixed Version

## âœ… Problem Fixed
The Docker build error was caused by trying to copy a `/sessions` directory that doesn't exist in the repository. This has been fixed in the updated `Dockerfile`.

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Upload Files to GitHub
Make sure your GitHub repository contains these files:
- `api_server.py` âœ…
- `requirements.txt` âœ…
- `Dockerfile` âœ… (Fixed version)
- `.dockerignore` âœ… (Updated)

### 2. Deploy to Render

1. **Go to Render.com**
   - Sign up/login at https://render.com
   - Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"

2. **Connect Repository**
   - Choose "Build and deploy from a Git repository"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository: `instagram-saved-search`

3. **Configure Service**
   ```
   Name: instagram-saved-search
   Region: Oregon (US West) or closest to you
   Branch: main
   Runtime: Docker
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   Add these in the "Environment" section:
   ```
   FLASK_ENV=production
   PORT=10000
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Wait for deployment (5-10 minutes)

### 3. Get Your API URL
After deployment, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://instagram-saved-search-xxxx.onrender.com
```

### 4. Update Mobile/Web Apps
Update the API URL in your apps:

**For Mobile App (App.js):**
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-app-name.onrender.com';
```

**For Web App (web-test.html):**
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-app-name.onrender.com';
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails:
1. Check the build logs in Render dashboard
2. Make sure all files are uploaded to GitHub
3. Verify the Dockerfile is the updated version

### If App Doesn't Start:
1. Check the service logs in Render
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure PORT is set to 10000

### If API Doesn't Respond:
1. Test the health endpoint: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health`
2. Check if the service is sleeping (free tier sleeps after 15 minutes)
3. Make a request to wake it up

## ðŸ“± Testing Your Deployment

1. **Health Check:**
   ```
   GET https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health
   ```

2. **Login Test:**
   ```
   POST https://your-app.onrender.com/api/login
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "username": "your_username",
     "password": "your_password"
   }
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Important Notes

- **Free Tier Limitations:**
  - Service sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
  - 750 hours per month (enough for personal use)
  - Cold start takes 30-60 seconds

- **Security:**
  - Your Instagram credentials are processed server-side
  - Sessions are stored temporarily in the container
  - No data is permanently stored

- **Performance:**
  - First request after sleep will be slow
  - Subsequent requests are fast
  - Consider upgrading to paid tier for production use

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. Deploy the API server to Render
2. Update your mobile/web apps with the new URL
3. Test the complete flow
4. Share your app with others!

Your Instagram saved posts search app will be live and accessible from anywhere! ðŸŒŸ
